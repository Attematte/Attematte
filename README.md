### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Atte and thank you for looking into my Github profile! :)

I am a recent MBA graduate from Ã…bo Akademi University. 
In my Github profile, you can find some of the projects that I did at the university 
that helped me to achieve a final grade of 5/5 for my minor which was computer science. 
Some of the projects include basic programming with Python, whereas the other projects are more concentrated on data analysis and visualization with Python.  
I have also included some business intelligence projects with Excell. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rehearsing my skills in data analytics with Python and SQL.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for a job in which I can grow and utilize the existing skills in analytics and programming that I have learned during my studies!
