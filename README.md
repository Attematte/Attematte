### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Atte and thank you for looking into my Github profile!

Here you can find some of my projects that I have done. Most of them are done as a part of my computer science and IT studies at the university, except the Google Ads marketing project. The projects include data analytics with Python and Excel, data vizualisation with Tableau, but also projects with basic Python programming. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rehearsing my skills in data analytics with Python and SQL.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for a job in which I can grow and utilize the existing skills in analytics and programming that I have learned during my studies!
