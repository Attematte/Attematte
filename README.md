### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Atte and thank you for looking into my Github profile!

Here you can find some of my projects that I have done. Most of them include data analytics with Python and Excel and data vizualisation with Tableau however, there are a few projects that are done with basic Python programming. In addition to these, you will be able to find my Google ads marketing project in which I created marketing campaigns and analyzed the campaign data to further improve the marketing campaigns.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rehearsing my skills in data analytics with Python and SQL.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for a job in which I can grow and utilize my existing skills in analytics and programming!
