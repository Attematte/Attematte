### Hello,

My name is Atte and thank you for looking into my Github profile.

Here you can find some of my projects. Most of them include data analytics with Python and Excel and data vizualisation with Tableau however, there are a few projects that are done with basic Python programming. In addition to these, you will be able to find my Google ads marketing project in which I created marketing campaigns and analyzed the campaign data to further improve the marketing campaigns.
